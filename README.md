# clicky-game
## React application

### Project Details:
* Application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events
* Application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will increment when clicking an image for the first time and the user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle in a random order
* After each incorrect guess, the current score is reset to 0 and the game will save the highest score
